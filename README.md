##Pentesting Proxy Tool

This is a versatile GUI-based proxy tool designed for penetration testing purposes. It combines proxy functionalities with additional features like vulnerability scanning, Tor routing, and request replay. The tool can intercept and analyze HTTP/HTTPS requests, replay requests, and evaluate potential security vulnerabilities.

#Features

Intercept HTTP Requests and Responses

Logs all intercepted requests in a user-friendly GUI.

Provides a mock response for demonstration purposes.

Basic Vulnerability Scanning

Detects potential open redirects.

Identifies SQL injection patterns.

Alerts on sensitive information leaks (e.g., API keys, passwords).

Request Replayer

Replay any HTTP request directly from the GUI.

Tor Integration

Option to route all requests through the Tor network.

Expandable Framework

The codebase can be extended to add custom modules for specific pentesting tasks.

HTTP Header Analysis (Coming Soon)

Future enhancement to evaluate the security of HTTP headers.

Installation Guide

Requirements

System Requirements:

Python 3.x

A Linux distribution or Windows (Linux recommended for Tor support)

Administrator/root privileges for installing dependencies

Dependencies:

PyQt5 for GUI

stem for Tor control

requests for HTTP handling

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pentesting-proxy-tool.git
cd pentesting-proxy-tool

Run the setup script:

./setup.sh

This script:

Installs the necessary Python packages.

Configures Tor for proxying requests.

Starts the application.

Launch the tool:

python3 proxy_tool.py

Usage Instructions

Starting the Proxy

Click the Start Proxy button in the GUI to launch the HTTP server.

Set your browser or testing tool to route traffic through http://localhost:8080.

Intercept Requests

As HTTP requests pass through, they are displayed in the GUI.

Analyze Vulnerabilities

Each intercepted request is scanned for vulnerabilities such as open redirects, SQL injection patterns, and sensitive data leakage.

Replay Requests

Click Replay Request to enter a URL and replay the HTTP request. The response code is displayed in a dialog box.

Use Tor for Anonymity

Click Connect to Tor to route requests through the Tor network.

Use Cases

Penetration Testing

Evaluate web applications for common vulnerabilities using built-in scanning features.

Web Development Debugging

Intercept requests during development to analyze and debug API calls.

Anonymized Browsing and Testing

Use Tor integration to anonymize HTTP requests for privacy and testing purposes.

HTTP Request Replay

Modify and replay captured HTTP requests to evaluate server responses and test business logic.

Potential Improvements

Save Logs: Implement the ability to export logs to a file for later analysis.

Custom Exploits: Add modules for detecting more complex vulnerabilities.

HTTPS Support: Expand support for HTTPS traffic interception and decryption.

Multi-Threading: Improve server responsiveness by handling requests concurrently.

Notes

Use this tool responsibly and only for authorized testing purposes.

Ensure compliance with legal and ethical guidelines while performing penetration testing.
